## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment

***  

### Introduction to the Repository 
 
1. This repository was created as submission for the peer-graded assignment of Course 3: Getting And Cleaning Data, part of Data Science Specialization Course of Johns Hopkins University (Coursera.org), 

2. Goal -  To demonstrate the ability to  clean a given dataset inorder to prepare tidy dataset that can be used for further analysis. 

3. The assignment requires submisison of link to a github repository with the following:

    * A tidy dataset.
    * Script for performing the analysis namely, run_analysis.R.
    * Code Book (CodeBook.md) that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that        was performed to clean the data.
    * A README.md in the repository

### The Raw Dataset

4.    One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to the course website represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

      http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

5.    The data for the project is available from the following link - 

      https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

6.    The zipped file creates a directory called 'UCI HAR Dataset' which has the raw data.

### Files in the Repository

##### 7. README.md - 
      It is the file you read right now. It explains the purpose and the contents of the repository.

##### 8.  CodeBook.md 
      The code book contains detailed information on the the various files in the repository. 

##### 9.  run_analysis.R 
      It is the main script of the repository. It is described in detail in the file,'CodeBook.md'.

##### 10. tidy_data_summary.txt 
      The tidy dataset that was produced by the script 'run_analysis.txt'. It  contains the averages of selected features from the original 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0'.Details are covered in the file, 'CodeBook.md'.
